# Project 2: Nondeterministic Finite Automata

* Authors: Keegan Saunders and Juan Becerra
* Class: CS361 Section 1

## Overview

Nondeterministic Finite Automata builds off of our previous DFA assignment, which allowed a user to create a finite-state machine and test a list of strings on it to see if the machine would accept them. While NFA‚Äôs and DFA‚Äôs are equivalent in power, it‚Äôs often easier to develop a non-deterministic machine and converting it into a deterministic machine for real-world applications. One of the biggest features of this assignment is allowing users to create an NFA that can easily be converted into a DFA with a single method, getDFA(), which in turn calls several other useful functions, like getToState(from, symb) and eClosure(state). <sup><sup>Bette is butt.</sup></sup>

## Compiling and Using

To compile the program, go to the project root directory type the console command:

```
javac fa/nfa/NFADriver.java
```

then, run the program by typing the console command:

```
java fa.nfa.NFADriver ./tests/[TESTFILE]
```

Where the TESTFILE options are:
- p2tc0.txt
- p2tc1.txt
- p2tc2.txt
- p2tc3.txt

## Discussion

Much of our approach for this assignment was modeled after the provided DFA.java and DFAState.java files, in addition to some of the work we accomplished in the previous assignment. We started work in NFAState.java where much of the code reflected the DFAState equivalent. However, one of the biggest changes we made was changing the delta hashmap from a key value pair of ‚ÄúCharacter, DFAState‚Äù to ‚ÄúCharacter, Set<NFAState>‚Äù. This was because, while it was true that a DFA state would deterministically transition to another state on a character, an NFA could go to any number of states (or even none at all) on a character. From there, we modified addTransition() to add to this set of states rather than simply mapping a single character to a single state, like in DFAState. We then modified getTo() to return an empty set if the transition does not exist rather than throwing an error (we‚Äôll get into why we did this later in the ‚ÄúTesting‚Äù section).

We then modified getTo() to return an empty set if the transition does not exist rather than throwing an error (we‚Äôll get into why we did this later in the ‚ÄúTesting‚Äù section).

In NFA.java, we also modeled many of our basic methods after what we found in the provided DFA.java, and our old DFA implementation. The following methods:
-	Constructor
-	addStartState()
-	addState()
-	addFinalState()
-	addTransition()
-	getStates()
-	getFinalStates()
-	getStartState()
-	getABC()

were implemented almost exactly like they were in DFA, as one would expect. We excluded some error checking as they weren‚Äôt really needed for this assignment besides debugging during development. The most significant changes made for this assignment were done in getDFA(), getToState(), and eClosure().

### eClosure()
The eClosure() method returns a set of states that a state can transition to given the empty transition. It was implemented using a recursive depth-first search helper method, eClosureRecursiveSearch(Set<NFAState> eClosure, NFAState s). To start, eClosure() creates a set of NFAStates and adds the argument state to it. It then returns eClosureRecursiveSearch, where that set and the given state is passed in as an argument. From there, eClosureRecursiveSearch() iterates through every state that the given state can get to on an ‚Äòe‚Äô. If that state is not within the set passed in, then it is an inserted, and the set of states is changed to whatever a further call of eClosureRecursiveSearch() returns. This will essentially keep viewing unexplored states and evaluating every state‚Äôs empty transitions in depth-first order, until the call stack returns a set of all explorable states. 

### getToState()
The getToState() method creates a ‚Äúreturn set‚Äù of states that will be returned, iterates through the eClosure() of the given states, applies the transition to all of the eClosure(), then once again calls eClosure() on every transition. The resulting set of states is then added to the ‚Äúreturn set‚Äù, which the method then returns. The idea of this method is to get all possible transitions that an NFA can take when it sees a symbol. This requires us to evaluate the eClosure() both before AND after applying the transition in order to correctly get all possible transitions that a set can take. As previously stated, we changed NFAState.getTo() to simply return an empty set rather than throwing an error. This is because we simply want to skip one of our for loops and return an empty set in getTo(), as this indicates that we can‚Äôt get anywhere given a start state and symbol.

### getDFA()
The getDFA() method returns a DFA equivalent to the current NFA. This was the most challenging method to implement, as it would essentially require us to program a series of steps used in NFA -> DFA transitions while adhering to the given DFA‚Äôs API. We begin by evaluating the eClosure of the NFA start state, which then becomes the start state of the DFA. We then enqueue this state and enter a loop that continues while the queue is not empty. The body of this loop iteratively evaluates states in a breadth-first manner, attempting to create transitions for every symbol in the alphabet, which inevitably creates new states that are inserted into the queue. Some other important details include iterating through the getToState() of the dequeued state, adding them into a bundled new state, tagging if this new state would be final, and seeing if this bundled state exists in a set (which would indicate that the state already exists and doesn‚Äôt need to be enqueued).

## Testing

Prior to getting larger methods like getToState() working, we ran our program in an alternate driver, which tested the functionality of dependent methods, like getToState() and eClosure(). Initially, our getToState() method simply called the NFAState.getTo() method. However, we discovered that this wouldn‚Äôt return the results that we‚Äôd expect. Our tests revealed that we simply calling getTo() would only return the transitions from directly taking a transition without possible empty transitions. We later fixed the getToState() method by taking the eClosure(), calling getTo(), then calling eClosure() again.

When testing eClosure() we ran into some cases that would give us stack overflows. This was due to our DFS algorithm evaluating empty transitions circularly. For instance, if we wanted to evaluate state ‚Äúa‚Äù with transitions aeb, bec, and cea, the algorithm would essentially keep exploring the path infinitely from a, to b, to c, and back to a. We fixed this by also passing an intermediate state set down the call-stack, which the algorithm would reference to avoid reevaluating states that it has already visited.

When testing our getDFA() implementation, we went through a number of different ideas. At first, we wanted to approach it like we did using tables in class for NFA -> DFA conversions. We‚Äôd essentially keep adding to a table of transitions, which would extend whenever new states are discovered. This proved to be a pretty big hassle in design, so we opted for a queue approach that would simply find all transitions for the dequeued state, and would enqueue any new discovered states. In this design, we kept getting empty error states in cases where we shouldn‚Äôt have them, such as p2tc0.txt. Print statements revealed that our algorithm was trying to find ‚Äòe‚Äô transitions for all discovered states, which would confuse our algorithm and consequently create many error states. We fixed this by ignoring the ‚Äòe‚Äô character in the NFA‚Äôs alphabet, and simply calling getToState() in our algorithm, which in turn handled the eClosure() of all states.

In the end, our implementation matched the output given for all tests, but with unordered states in the NFA (which should be fine according to the assignment). With all cases passing in both the given tests and our own alternate driver, we considered the assignment complete.
